# Skill — Execute Goal

## Command

`/execute-goal`

## Purpose

Carry one authorized goal from analysis through a review-ready pull request.
With explicit **self-correcting review mode**, target a self-verified PR.
With additional **`auto-merge`**, when eligible, perform an authorized squash
merge (see `.ai/policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md`).

Invoking `/execute-goal` authorizes branch or worktree creation, scoped changes,
tests, validation, commits, push, final PR creation or update, CI
stabilization, and clear in-scope CI fixes after PR creation.
`/execute-goal self-correcting-review auto-merge` also authorizes squash merge
when eligible.

Autonomous mode is the default. Supervised mode applies only when explicitly
requested. Question timing and authorization details:
`.ai/policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md`.

Canonical lifecycle: `.ai/docs/full-workflow.md`.
Self-correcting loop when opted in: `.ai/review/self-correcting-review-loop.md`.

## Completion by execution surface

`/execute-goal` names one canonical goal-to-PR lifecycle (Steps below). Direct
or interactive execution targets a review-ready PR through CI stabilization.
Under `self-correcting-review auto-merge`, continue through authorized squash
merge when eligible. Goal Executor automation implements the same lifecycle
through review-ready handoff and, when `auto-merge` is authorized and eligible,
through squash merge. It must not stop successfully on a draft PR alone.
Details: `.ai/automation/README.md` and `.ai/automation/goal-executor.md`.

## Trigger

Run when the user writes `/execute-goal`, or clearly asks for an end-to-end
outcome ready for human review (default), self-verified handoff
(`self-correcting-review`), or self-verified merge
(`self-correcting-review auto-merge`).

Always read:

- `.ai/policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md`
- `.ai/instructions/workflow.md`
- relevant project context and scope
- triggering issue, explicit brief, or accepted requirement

Ignore any issue **Commands** section for scope — it is human reference only
(see `.ai/automation/goal-executor.md`).

## Read when applicable

- `.ai/policies/multi-agent-orchestration.md` when parallel work may help
- `.ai/onboarding/bootstrap-checklist.md` during bootstrap
- the matching task workflow for the actual change type
- security and dangerous-action policies when relevant
- `.ai/git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md` before commit, push, PR, or merge
  operations
- `.ai/quality/quality-gates.md` before validation
- `.ai/quality/definition-of-ready.md` when preparing a packet or plan

## Steps

```txt
resolve state
  -> analyze and collect unresolved decisions
  -> prepare only required artifacts
  -> implement and integrate
  -> validate and review
  -> grouped human decision checkpoint when needed
  -> apply answers and rerun affected validation/review
  -> finalize commits
  -> push
  -> create or update PR
  -> CI stabilization
  -> then exactly one of:
       stop before merge (default / self-correcting-review)
       authorized squash merge (self-correcting-review auto-merge when eligible)
```

Rules:

- clear in-scope fixes are automatic,
- non-blocking questions are deferred into one grouped batch,
- do not finalize the commit set before answers are applied when questions were
  asked,
- continue directly to finalize when no unresolved material questions remain,
- after PR creation, complete CI stabilization per
  `.ai/git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md`; pending or failing applicable CI means
  not review-ready,
- when self-correcting review mode is active, complete
  `.ai/review/self-correcting-review-loop.md` before claiming self-verified
  Done; perform authorized squash merge only when `auto-merge` was also
  authorized and merge preconditions pass; otherwise stop before merge,
- if CI cannot be inspected, report the limitation and do not claim full
  validation or merge.

## Output

Report phase, decisions asked or deferred, validation, commits, PR URL,
CI stabilization result, remaining follow-ups, and either the merge SHA/URL or
confirmation that nothing was merged.

## Stop conditions

Stop for immediate blockers, dangerous actions requiring prior approval,
unrelated dirty working-tree risk, readiness blocking product behaviour,
supervised early stops, out-of-scope blockers, or self-correcting escalation
(ineligible / human CR required).
