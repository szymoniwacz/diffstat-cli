# Template Flow

## Purpose

This document explains how to start a project from this template.

Keep it simple.
Use it as the first human-readable guide before asking AI to implement anything.

## Default operating model

Prefer `/execute-goal` for one meaningful outcome, or whole-project
automation via a **Project Execution** issue and `/execute-project`. Agents
never merge except under authorized eligible `self-correcting-review auto-merge`.

Canonical rules:

- [`.ai/policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md`](../policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md)
- Full lifecycle order: [`.ai/docs/full-workflow.md`](full-workflow.md)

## Complete walkthrough

This section follows one generic example from zero to merged PR.
Details for gates, checklists, and task types live in linked documents — not here.

**Example:** a local CLI that reviews code diffs, starting with one language.

### At a glance

```txt
new project
  -> questions
  -> context and requirements
  -> project readiness
  -> first task via /execute-goal

new task
  -> /execute-goal with one scoped outcome
  -> agent completes preparation through review-ready PR when authorized
  -> human review and merge (default)
  -> or self-correcting-review: eligible self-verified handoff, human merges
  -> or self-correcting-review auto-merge: eligible self-verified squash merge

whole product (comment- and merge-triggered automation)
  -> Project Execution issue + /execute-project
  -> or /execute-project self-correcting-review (skip CR; you merge)
  -> or /execute-project self-correcting-review auto-merge (skip CR; agent squash-merges when eligible)
  -> Project Executor selects one goal at a time
  -> Goal Executor completes each delegated goal per the automation contract
  -> human review and merge each PR (default / self-correcting-review), or Goal Executor squash-merges when auto-merge eligible
  -> merged PR triggers Project Executor for the next goal until completion criteria pass
```

This walkthrough describes the complete canonical `/execute-goal` lifecycle.
Direct or interactive execution continues through CI stabilization to a
review-ready pull request. Goal Executor Cursor Automation implements the same
lifecycle through review-ready handoff (never stopping successfully on draft
alone) per [`.ai/automation/README.md`](../automation/README.md) and
[`.ai/automation/goal-executor.md`](../automation/goal-executor.md).
Project Executor Cursor Automation selects at most one delegated goal per run
(issue comment or merged delegated pull request) and stops after Goal
Executor review-ready handoff for human merge per
[`.ai/automation/project-executor.md`](../automation/project-executor.md).

### 1. Start a new project

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Create a repo from this template. Open it in your AI tool. Run `/project-intake` with a rough description. |
| **AI** | Asks short clarifying rounds (at most 5 questions at once). Skips what you already answered. |
| **AI may ask** | “What is out of scope for v1?” “Local only or CI later?” “Which language first?” |
| **Result** | Updated `.ai/project/*` and `.ai/docs/project-requirements.md`. No application code yet. |
| **You next** | Answer questions. Repeat until definition coverage is complete. |

```txt
/project-intake

I want to build a local CLI that reviews code changes in a repository.
It should analyze diffs, not the whole project at first.
It should work locally first.
Later it may run in CI.
Start with one language. No web UI. No auto-fixes for now.
```

Setup checklist: [`.ai/onboarding/bootstrap-checklist.md`](../onboarding/bootstrap-checklist.md)

### 2. Clarify missing details

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Answer only what you know. Say when something is undecided. |
| **AI** | Records facts in project docs. Marks unknowns as assumptions or open questions. |
| **AI may say** | “I will record ‘GitHub Actions later’ as an assumption.” “Open question: rule pack format?” |
| **Result** | Requirements doc lists assumptions and open questions separately from decided facts. |
| **You next** | Resolve blockers before project readiness, or accept documented open questions. |

### 3. Save context and requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Confirm the written context matches your intent. Customize template placeholders for the product. |
| **AI** | Updates vision, scope, roadmap, glossary, and requirements. Does not start product code. |
| **Result** | `.ai/project/vision.md`, `product-context.md`, `scope.md`, `roadmap.md`, `glossary.md`, and `.ai/docs/project-requirements.md`. |
| **You next** | Finish definition coverage for every decision area. |

Decision areas and statuses: [`.ai/contracts/project-definition-contract.md`](../contracts/project-definition-contract.md)

### 4. Reach project readiness

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Remove bootstrap markers, record real stack and commands, confirm no blockers remain. |
| **AI** | Helps verify checklist items. Stops product implementation until the gate passes. |
| **AI may say** | “The stack profile is not selected yet, and the real test command is still missing.” |
| **Result** | Project readiness gate passed. Repository identity describes the product. |
| **You next** | Start the first product task. |

Gate details: [`.ai/onboarding/bootstrap-checklist.md`](../onboarding/bootstrap-checklist.md)

### 5. Start a task

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Pick a task route: backlog idea, accepted requirement, bug report, or direct scoped request. |
| **AI** | Confirms the project is ready. Routes to the right preparation for the change type. |
| **AI may ask** | “Is this from the backlog or an accepted requirement?” “Bug report or small feature?” |
| **Result** | A clear task input. Idea capture is optional when work already comes from requirements, a bug, or a direct request. |
| **You next** | Create required preparation (brief, task packet, and/or plan). |

Task routes and required preparation: [`.ai/quality/definition-of-ready.md`](../quality/definition-of-ready.md)

**Example — backlog idea:**

```txt
/add-idea

Add idea: first language pack for code review rules.
Documentation-only first version. No parser yet.
```

### 6. Choose brief, task packet, and plan

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Prefer `/execute-goal` for the full outcome. Use `/plan-small-step` only when you want preparation without implementation. |
| **AI** | Creates a task packet and/or accepts an explicit brief. Produces a plan in `.ai/plans/` when required. Under `/execute-goal`, continues through routine phases without a new prompt between them. |
| **AI may say** | “This feature needs a task packet and plan before coding.” “Trivial doc fix — brief is enough.” |
| **Result** | Ready for planning, then implementation-ready when gates and any required approvals are satisfied. |
| **You next** | For supervised stops, approve the plan scope. Otherwise let `/execute-goal` continue. |

Preparation matrix: [`.ai/quality/definition-of-ready.md`](../quality/definition-of-ready.md)
Primary command: `/execute-goal`
Planning-only command: `/plan-small-step`

```txt
/execute-goal

Create the folder structure and first rule document for the language pack.
Do not implement analysis logic yet.
```

### 7. Questions, assumptions, blockers, and approvals

Question timing belongs to
[`.ai/policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md`](../policies/autonomy-and-authorization.md).
This guide does not own lifecycle order.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Missing detail** | If safe work can continue, AI records it for the Decision queue and keeps going. |
| **Reasonable guess** | AI records an assumption in the packet or plan and states it in the handoff. |
| **Undecided design** | Non-blocking design choices go to the Decision queue; work continues where safe. |
| **Hard blocker** | AI stops only when no safe work remains or prior approval is mandatory. |
| **Risky change** | AI requests explicit approval when the preparation matrix or dangerous-actions policy requires it. See [`.ai/quality/definition-of-ready.md`](../quality/definition-of-ready.md) and [`.ai/policies/dangerous-actions.md`](../policies/dangerous-actions.md). |
| **Incomplete plan** | AI extends or narrows the plan before coding that part. |

### 8. Implement, validate, review, decide, then PR

Under `/execute-goal`, one authorized goal continues through preparation,
implementation, validation, review, the grouped decision checkpoint when needed,
then commits, push, PR, and CI stabilization. Full stage order:
[`.ai/docs/full-workflow.md`](full-workflow.md). Automation completion
boundary: see [At a glance](#at-a-glance) and
[`.ai/automation/README.md`](../automation/README.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Prefer `/execute-goal` for the full outcome. Answer the grouped decision batch when asked. |
| **AI** | Changes files within scope. Fixes clear in-scope failures. Prefers independent review; self-review is the fallback. Asks one grouped decision batch after validation and review when material questions remain. Completion boundary: see [At a glance](#at-a-glance). Merges only under authorized eligible `self-correcting-review auto-merge`. |
| **AI may say** | “That request is outside the scope — should I add it as a follow-up idea?” |
| **Result** | PR outcome per [At a glance](#at-a-glance) and the automation contract. |
| **You next** | Human review and merge after review-ready handoff (default / self-correcting-review), or confirm auto-merge when that form was used. |

```txt
/execute-goal

Implement the implementation-ready scope for this task only.
```

Operational rules: [`.ai/instructions/workflow.md`](../instructions/workflow.md)
Quality gates: [`.ai/quality/quality-gates.md`](../quality/quality-gates.md)
Review checklist: [`.ai/review/ai-review-checklist.md`](../review/ai-review-checklist.md)
PR workflow: [`.ai/git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md`](../git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md)

### 8b. Whole-project automation (optional)

Use this when you want to describe the product once and let automation select
goals sequentially. Default and `self-correcting-review` wait for your manual
merges; with `/execute-project self-correcting-review auto-merge`, eligible
delegated PRs are squash-merged by Goal Executor.

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Create a **Project Execution** issue. Fill product outcome and completion criteria. Comment exactly `/execute-project`, `/execute-project self-correcting-review`, or `/execute-project self-correcting-review auto-merge`. Configure Project Executor per [`.ai/automation/project-executor-production-setup.md`](../automation/project-executor-production-setup.md). |
| **AI** | Project Executor selects at most one next goal and delegates to Goal Executor. Handoff/merge rules: [`.ai/automation/goal-executor.md`](../automation/goal-executor.md). Post-merge continuation: [`.ai/automation/project-executor.md`](../automation/project-executor.md). |
| **Result** | A sequence of pull requests, one scoped goal at a time. |
| **You next** | Default / self-correcting-review: review and merge each PR. Auto-merge eligible: answer material decisions only. Use `/continue-project` only after material decisions or an unexpected stop. |

Runtime: [`.ai/automation/project-executor.md`](../automation/project-executor.md)

### 9. Human review and merge

| | |
|---|---|
| **You** | Default / self-correcting-review / escalated: review diff, diff-risk note, and checklists; approve, request changes, or reject; merge. `auto-merge` eligible: no CR or merge required. |
| **AI** | Default / self-correcting-review / escalated: does not merge. `self-correcting-review auto-merge` eligible: Goal Executor squash-merges per [`.ai/git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md`](../git/branch-and-pr-workflow.md). |
| **Result** | Work on `main` via human squash merge or authorized `auto-merge` squash merge. |
| **You next** | Start the next scoped task (or let Project Executor continue after merge). |

---

**Side paths during task work**

- **Out-of-scope idea mid-task:** AI captures it in `.ai/ideas/` or notes a follow-up; does not expand scope silently.
- **Tests fail:** fix within scope or revise the plan before continuing.
- **No GitHub PR workflow:** review handoff is still required; PR stages are skipped.

## Main rule

Do not start with code.

Start with project context and readiness.

## Commands

| Command | Use when |
|---|---|
| `/execute-goal` | You want one outcome carried through the canonical goal-to-PR lifecycle. See [At a glance](#at-a-glance) for the automation boundary. |
| `/execute-goal self-correcting-review` | Same as `/execute-goal`, plus eligible self-verified handoff (you still merge). |
| `/execute-goal self-correcting-review auto-merge` | Same as self-correcting-review, plus eligible Goal Executor squash merge. |
| `/execute-project` | GitHub comment on a **Project Execution** issue authorizing whole-project automation and starting the first step. Setup: [`.ai/automation/project-executor-production-setup.md`](../automation/project-executor-production-setup.md). |
| `/execute-project self-correcting-review` | Same as `/execute-project`, plus self-correcting mode on delegated goals (you still merge). |
| `/execute-project self-correcting-review auto-merge` | Same as self-correcting-review, plus eligible Goal Executor squash merge on delegated goals. |
| `/continue-project` | Optional nudge after material-decision answers or an unexpected stop. Ordinary resume: Goal Executor PR-head CI; Project Executor merge + default-branch CI. |
| `/project-intake` | Starting a new project and you want AI to ask questions. |
| `/define-project` | You already have a rough description and want AI to organize it. |
| `/add-idea` | You want to add a new idea to the backlog. |
| `/expand-idea` | You want to refine an idea before planning. |
| `/plan-small-step` | You want a task packet and plan prepared without implementing. |

Alternative intake mode: `/define-project` produces the same project artifacts as `/project-intake`.

## Task routes

After project readiness, work may start from:

| Route | When to use |
|---|---|
| Backlog idea | New candidate work that needs refinement in `.ai/ideas/` |
| Accepted requirement | Scoped work already recorded in requirements |
| Bug report | Defect with reproduction and expected behavior |
| Direct scoped request | Small bounded change with explicit brief when allowed |

Required preparation for each route is defined in
[`.ai/quality/definition-of-ready.md`](../quality/definition-of-ready.md).
Task-type playbooks live in [`.ai/workflows/`](../workflows/).
